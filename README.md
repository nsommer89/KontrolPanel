  - **Debian** 11, 12

## 🛠️ Installation

> ⚠️ It is **highly recommended** to run KontrolPanel on a fresh server, as the installer will modify system packages and services.
> Alternatively, you can try it inside a Docker container:

`docker run -p 80:80 -p 443:443 -p 22:22 -p 8200:8200 -a stdin -a stdout -i -t ubuntu:24.04 /bin/bash`

### 🔹 Step 1: Prepare the system (required for Debian/Ubuntu)

Before running the installer, ensure required tools are available:

```bash
apt-get update -y && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends curl ca-certificates
```
### 🔹 Step 2: Install KontrolPanel

```bash
bash <(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nsommer89/KontrolPanel/master/install.sh) --yes
```
